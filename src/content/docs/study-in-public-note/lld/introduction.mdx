- Typical format: 35–40 minutes to design an OOD implementation (interfaces, classes, fields, methods, relationships).
- Clarify each class’s responsibilities and boundaries before coding. Ask questions, then design for encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Be ready to describe relationships (a quick UML-style sketch verbally is fine even if you don’t draw).
